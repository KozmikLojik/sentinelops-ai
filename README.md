# SentinelOps AI

Simulation-first AI robotics operations platform.

## Overview
SentinelOps AI is a software-only system that simulates a robotic agent,
runs an AI decision loop, and exposes robot state, decisions, and logs
through a centralized backend and web dashboard.

## Scope (Intentional)
- Single simulated robot
- Single task
- Single AI decision loop
- No physical hardware

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- AI Agent: Rule-based decision engine
- Simulation: Python logic
- Frontend: HTML
- Infrastructure: Vultr VM

## Status
🚧 In active development
